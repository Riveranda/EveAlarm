River, I will say this a million times, you're not a drug to me and never were. You were a best friend and like a mother to me like how you said I was like a son to you. The relationship you me and your daughter had, especially you, meant more to me than anything. I don't want to be an "addict" as you think I do. I want to have a discussion about this like adults. You said I meant something to you before I went "psycho". I would give ANYTHING to go back and not have that happen, but I can't. If everything is preordained like you say it is, why can't you just forgive knowing that for whatever reason it was supposed to happen? When I was depressed as a kid and suicidal, I'd tell you to just forget me and you said it wasn't possible to forget me. Please remember the good times we had, I know those 4 years meant a lot to you, and give me one more chance, just one chance, a "limited access" chance as you called it. I will impress the hell out of you. Please. You said one stupid message and it would be 1 month. Only 1 month. It's been like 2 and a half months. Please don't do this for years again. You know what my discord/rs etc is, please. Saying I'm sorry a million times won't come close to how I feel about this to you. Sorry a million times doesn't cut it. Please forgive me. You said over the summer we could have a proper relationship like we used to. You said later I was the reason we couldn't and I promise you I'm ready. I've beyond learned my lesson and want this healthy relationship again. I love you and care for you way way too much to throw 10 years away. I thank God everyday he allowed me to meet you as a kid and how close we got to be.
